# Voxl Engine
My attempt at a custom made game engine.
Created in C++ to force myself to learn it, at least to an intermediate level.


# Planned Features
* Basic 3D rendering
* Textures
* Basic Graphical User Interface
* Basic Lighting
* Basic Shaders
* Voxel Terrain
  
# Concept Art
How I would want the engine to look if I don't give up
